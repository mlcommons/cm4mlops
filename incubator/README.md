# CK incubator 

This directory contains community projects to improve and extend the CK framework:

* [cBench](cbench) - collaborative benchmarking toolset connected with cKnowledge.io
  *We plan to convert it to the [CK2 format](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/ck2)*.

The following projects have been aggregated within the new [CK2 framework (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/ck2)
* ~~[connectMe](connectme) - CK2 prototyping~~
* ~~[CK lite](ck-lite) - light CMD for CK repos~~
* ~~[cDataBase](cdatabase) - Pythonic interface to CK repos~~
