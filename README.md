### About

The [Collective Knowledge project (CK)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149) 
is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing experiments 
from [150 research papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility)
and validating them in the real world - we decided to collaborate with the community 
to develop a universal, human-readable and technology-agnostic interface 
to access any software project and run it on any platform with any software, hardware and data.

The [Collective Mind workflow automation framework (CM aka CK2)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm/cmind)
is the 2nd version of the CK technology being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md).
It helps users to add this universal CLI and Python API to their software projects in a transparent and non-intrusive way 
by reusing [portable CM scripts from the community](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md)
that solve the "dependency hell" across rapidly evolving software, hardware and data.

The CM framework is powering a [free and open-source automation platform](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/platform) 
also being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
to help users find the most efficient and reproducible way to run their applications
with any data on any software/hardware stack from the cloud to the edge at any given time.

It automatically generates the most suitable, reproducible and deployable solution
to run AI, ML and other emerging applications based on user requirements and constraints 
including costs, throughput, latency, power consumption, accuracy, target devices (cloud/edge/mobile/tiny),
environment and data sets.

This technology is successfully used by the community and companies 
including Qualcomm, Neural Magic, Krai, DELL, HPE and Lenovo
to automate their MLPerf inference submissions and make them more reproducible and reusable.

Our goal is to help everyone focus on innovation by automating all their tedious and repetitive tasks
and slashing their research, development, benchmarking, optimization and deployment time and costs
by 10..100 times across continuously changing software, hardware and data.
