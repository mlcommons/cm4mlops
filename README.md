# CM4MLOps repository

**CM4MLOps** repository is powered by the [Collective Mind automation framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm), 
a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/cmind/) with a CLI and API designed for creating and managing automations. 

Two key automations developed using CM are **Script** and **Cache**, which streamline machine learning (ML) workflows, 
including managing Docker runs. Both Script and Cache automations are part of the **cm4mlops** repository.

The CM scripts, also housed in this repository, consist of hundreds of modular Python-wrapped scripts accompanied 
by `yaml` metadata, enabling the creation of robust and flexible ML workflows.

- **CM Scripts Documentation**: [https://docs.mlcommons.org/cm4mlops/](https://docs.mlcommons.org/cm4mlops/)
- **CM CLI Documentation**: [https://docs.mlcommons.org/ck/specs/cm-cli/](https://docs.mlcommons.org/ck/specs/cm-cli/)  

The `mlperf-branch` of the **cm4mlops** repository is dedicated to developments specific to MLPerf Inference. 
Please submit any pull requests (PRs) to this branch. For more information about using CM for MLPerf Inference, 
refer to the [MLPerf Inference Documentation](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference/).
