### About

We deeply believe in the power of open science and open source to solve the world's most challenging problems.

Following our [tedious experience reproducing 150 research papers and validating them in the real world](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility),
we started developing this open-source Collective Knowledge technology to provide a common interface to access and reuse
all shared knowledge (research projects, experiments, AI/ML models, code and data), facilitate reproducible research, 
and simplify transfer to production across rapidly evolving models, software, hardware and data 
as described in our [ACM REP'23 keynote](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339).

Collective Knowledge project consists of the following sub-projects:
* Non-intrusive and technology-agnostic [Collective Mind automation language (CM)](cm) to bridge the growing gap between research and production. It is extended by the community via
  * [Common CM automations](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/automation) 
  * [Portable and reusable CM scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script)
* [Collective Knowledge Platform (CK Playground)](https://access.cKnowledge.org) to provide a user-friendly GUI 
  to help the community explore, reproduce and reuse the state-of-the-art AI, ML and Systems research.

The first practical use case for CM language and CK platform is to let everyone from an expert to a child participate in collaborative benchmarking,
optimization and validation of the state-of-the-art AI/ML applications across rapidly evolving models, data, software and hardware 
from different vendors - see our [reproducibility and optimization challenges](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges), 
[shared benchmarking and optimization results for ML Systems (performance, accuracy, power consumption, costs)](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments) 
and the [leaderboard](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=contributors).
