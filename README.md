### About

We deeply believe in the power of open science and open source to solve the world's most challenging problems.
That's why we are developing the open-source Collective Knowledge platform powered by the Collective Mind automation language
to facilitate reproducible AI, ML and Systems research, knowledge unification and technology transfer 
to production across rapidly evolving software, hardware, models and data.

The first practical use case for our technology is to let everyone from an expert to a child participate in collaborative benchmarking,
optimization and validation of the state-of-the-art AI/ML applications across rapidly evolving models, data, software and hardware 
from different vendors - see our [reproducibility and optimization challenges](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges), 
[shared results (performance, accuracy, power consumption, costs)](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments) 
and the [leaderboard](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=contributors).

Check [our keynote](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339) at the 1st ACM conference on reproducibility and replicability (July 2023)
to learn about our vision and development plans.

Read [our documentation](docs/README.md) to learn about how our open-source technology can help you.
