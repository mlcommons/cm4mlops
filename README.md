### About

The Collective Knowledge project (CK) is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing experiments 
from [150 research papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility)
and validating them in the real world.
We have created a cross-platform tool to transform software projects
into a [database of portable and reusable scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md) 
adaptable to continuously changing software, hardware and data. 
It's being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
to help the community reduce development, benchmarking, optimization and deployment time for ML and AI systems.
