# Collective Knowledge approach

Developing modern applications and deploying them in the real world 
is becoming increasingly challenging, time consuming and costly.
Researchers and engineers spend lots of their precious time on continuous, tedious and ad-hoc 
development of complex automation scripts to build, test and optimize such applications
across rapidly evolving software and hardware from the cloud to the edge.

The Collective Knowledge concept is to turn any existing automation scripts
into [reusable, portable, customizable and deterministic components](cm-mlops/script) 
with a unified API, human readable CLI and extensible JSON/YAML meta description.

Our mission is to help the community share their knowledge,
experience and ad-hoc scripts in such a way that they can be easily reused
in different projects to automatically generate portable workflows, 
applications and web services adaptable to any software and hardware. 

You can read more about this concept and how it helps to modularize AI and ML Systems,
automate ML and AI benchmarking and support reproducible research [here](cm/docs/motivation.md).

## Collective Mind toolkit

CM toolkit is the second generation of the [original CK framework](#collective-knowledge-framework-ck).
It is being developed by the [open workgroup](docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) with a primary focus 
to modularize AI and ML systems, make it easier to plug real-world tasks, models, data sets, software 
and hardware from the cloud to the edge, automate their deployment in production,
and make them adaptable to continuously changing software and hardware.

You can find further info at the [CM development page](cm).

## Collective Knowledge framework (CK)

This legacy framework was originally developed to [make it easier to reproduce research papers and validate them in production in the real world](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility).
After it was successfully validated in several [academic and industrial projects including MLPerf](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
the author donated CK to [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org) to continue developing it as a community effort within the [open workgroup](docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md).
The feedback from the users has helped our workgroup to develop the next generation of the CK technology called [Collective Mind](#collective-mind-toolkit).

Go to the [CK project page](ck1) to get the legacy CK framework v2.6.1 or check the [new CM (CK2) development project](#collective-mind-toolkit).

## Contributing

The best way to contribute to this project is to join our [open workgroup](docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to help the community modularize AI, ML and other complex systems, 
share your ML artifacts and automations as [reusable CM scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script)
and improve the core CM functionality.
