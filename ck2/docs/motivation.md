# Motivation

CM transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks, zip/tar files
and any local directory into a globally accessible database of reusable artifacts 
and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

We want to accelerate innovation by providing a common and simple communication language
for researchers and engineers to help them exchange their artifacts, knowledge, experience 
and best practices in a more automated, reusable, portable and reproducible way.
                             
It is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when we and our colleagues have spent many months analyzing the ad-hoc structure of shared research projects to reproduce their results
and [adapt them to the real world](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) 
with continuously changing software, hardware, environments, data sets and settings.

The CM toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to 
[enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
[connect MLOps and DevOps by treating models, datasets and other artifacts as "code" packages](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops),
modularize the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).
