# Motivation

The Collective Mind toolkit (CM or CK2) transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks and zip/tar files
into a collective database of reusable artifacts and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

It is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when our colleagues have spent many months analyzing the structure of ad-hoc projects, reproducing results
and [validating them in the real world](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) 
with different and continuously changing software, hardware, environments, data sets and settings.

That is why we have decided to develop a simple toolkit to help you share your artifacts, knowledge, 
experience and best practices with the whole world in a more reusable, automated, 
portable and reproducible way.

The CM toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to 
[enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
modularize the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).
