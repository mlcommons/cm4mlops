# Motivation

CM transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks, zip/tar files
and any local directory into a globally accessible database of reusable artifacts 
and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

We believe that we can reduce the complexity of existing projects and accelerate innovation 
by providing a common and simple language to help researchers and engineers exchange their artifacts, 
knowledge, experience and best practices in a more automated, reusable, portable and reproducible way.
                             
It is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when our colleagues have spent many frustrating months analyzing numerous README files, specifications, technical reports, scripts, APIs and the content 
of these projects to reproduce experimental results, integrate shared tools with the existing infrastructure 
and [validate them to the real world](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) 
with continuously changing software, hardware, environments, data sets and settings.

The CM toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to 
[enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
[connect MLOps and DevOps by treating models, datasets and other artifacts as "code" packages](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops),
modularize the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).
