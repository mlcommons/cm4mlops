# Motivation

The Collective Mind toolkit (CM) transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks, zip/tar files
and any local directory into a collective database of reusable artifacts 
and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

Our goal is to help researchers and engineers exchange their artifacts, knowledge, 
experience and best practices in a more automated, reusable, portable and unified way
across rapidly evolving software and hardware.

CM is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when [our colleagues](https://ctuning.org/ae/committee.html) have spent many frustrating months communicating with each other 
and trying to understand numerous technical reports, README files, specifications, dependencies, 
ad-hoc scripts, tools, APIs, models and data sets of all shared projects 
to be able to [validate experimental results](https://cknowledge.io/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22) 
and adapt ad-hoc projects to the real world with very diverse 
and continuously changing software, hardware, user environments, settings and data.

The Collective Mind toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept (CK)]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to provide a simple, common and extensible format 
and API for shared projects and make it easier for researchers and engineers to communicate, collaborate and innovate.
The CK prototype was used to [enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
[connect MLOps and DevOps](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops) by treating models, datasets and other artifacts as "code" packages,
[automate the MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).
We are desiging the CM toolkit based on all the feedback we have received from these projects.
