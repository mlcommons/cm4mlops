# Motivation

CM transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks, zip/tar files
and any local directory into a collective database of reusable artifacts 
and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

Our goal is to help researchers and engineers exchange their artifacts, knowledge, 
experience and best practices in a more unified, automated, reusable, portable and reproducible way
across rapidly evolving software and hardware.

It is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when we have spent many frustrating months communicating with researchers and engineers 
to understand numerous README files, specifications, SW/HW dependencies, ad-hoc scripts, tools, APIs, models and data sets
of their projects to be able to [reproduce experimental results](https://cTuning.org/ae) 
and [adapt them to the real world](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) 
with continuously changing software, hardware, user environments, settings and data.

That is why we believe that having a simple, common and extensible format and API for shared projects 
will make it easier for researchers and engineers to communicate, collaborate and innovate
when developing complex computational systems.

The CM toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to 
[enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
[connect MLOps and DevOps by treating models, datasets and other artifacts as "code" packages](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops),
modularize the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).
