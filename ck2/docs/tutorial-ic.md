## Installing CM

CM toolkit is implemented as a small Python library with a unified CLI and a simple API.

It requires minimal dependencies (Python 3+, pip, pyyaml and a Git client) 
and should work with any OS including Linux, MacOS, CentOS, Debian, RedHat and Windows.

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install cmind
```

You can find more details about the installation process [here](installation.md).
