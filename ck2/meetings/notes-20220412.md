# 202200412: CM conf-call

Update on CM developments:

* Major redesign of the CK2/CM CLI based on user feedback 

  ```cm action automation artifacts flags @input.yaml @input.json```

Next steps:

* Finish many minor updates to the CM core this week (productivity, bug fixes, etc) 
  to stablize CM core API before developing the new meta package

Brainstorming:

* How to call our new meta package automation:   "obj", "object", "artifact", "component"? Need to aggree soon to start implementing
* How to represent platforms, OS and architecture in a new meta-package:
  - as 1 object with a long alias "rpi4-ubuntu20.04-arm64"
  - as 3 objects "rpi4", "ubuntu20.04", "arm64"

  There are pros and cons in that. Grigori is concerned about combinatorial explosion of aliases. Need to think more.

* Maybe provide sub-directories in our artifact directories based on tags to have a nice hierarchy.
  Grigori thinks it may be a good idea in the future but it's not yet a priority - letâ€™s discuss how to do it with the community. However, the new CM core should support hierarchy of directories.
