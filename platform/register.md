# Register for Collective Knowledge challenges

Please join the [public Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) 
from the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](../docs/taskforce.md) 
and send your name, organization and URL to @gfursin and @arjunsuresh 
(task force co-chairs and organizers of open challenges).

In the future, we plan to add a registration GUI to our [MLCommons Collective Knowledge playground](https://access.cKnowledge.org).
