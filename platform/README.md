# Collective Knowledge Platform

This free and open-source platform is being developed by the 
[open MLCommons taskforce](https://cKnowledge.org/mlcommons-taskforce)
to automatically find the most efficient and reproducible way to run AI, ML and any other application 
with any data on any software/hardware stack from the cloud to the edge at any given time.

See our development plan [here](https://cKnowledge.org/mlcommons-taskforce) 
and join [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) to discuss this project,
request your features and participate in developments.
