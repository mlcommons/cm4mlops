### Challenge

Develop a reference implementation of any MLPerf inference benchmark to run on Amazon Inferentia.
Submit preliminary (unoptimized) benchmarking results to MLPerf inference v3.1 and beyond.

Join our public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) and/or
our [weekly conf-calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMNK1m_LhWm6jimZK6YE05hu4VH9usdbKJ3nBy-ZPAw/edit)
to discuss this challenge with the organizers.

Read [this documentation](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf/inference/README.md) 
to run reference implementations of MLPerf inference benchmarks 
using the CM automation language and use them as a base for your developments.
