This challenge is under preparation.

We plan to extend [MLCommons CM framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) 
to automatically compose high-performance and cost-efficient AI systems
based on MLPerf inference v4.0 results and [CM automation recipes](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts).

* A prototype of a GUI to generate CM commands to run MLPerf inference benchmarks is ready: [link](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=howtorun&bench_uid=39877bb63fb54725)
* A prototype of the infrastructure to reproduce MLPerf inference benchmark results is ready: [link](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=reproduce)

Contact the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md) for more details.
