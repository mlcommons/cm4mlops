### Challenge

Add support to run a reference implementation of any MLPerf inference benchmark using 
[Mojo language]( https://github.com/modularml/mojo ) 
from [Modular.ai](https://modular.ai).

Prepare, optimize and submit benchmarking results to MLPerf inference v3.1 with Mojo.

Check [this related challenge](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges&name=3e971d8089014d1f) for more details.

Join our public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) and/or
our [weekly conf-calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMNK1m_LhWm6jimZK6YE05hu4VH9usdbKJ3nBy-ZPAw/edit)
to discuss this challenge with the organizers.

Read [this documentation](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf/inference/README.md) 
to run reference implementations of MLPerf inference benchmarks 
using the CM automation language and use them as a base for your developments.

### Prizes

* *The first implementation will receive a cache prize from organizers.*
* *All contributors will participate in writing a common white paper about running and comparing MLPerf inference benchmarks out-of-the-box.*
* *All contributors will receive 1 point for submitting valid results for 1 complete benchmark on one system.*
* *The top contributors will receive cash prizes from [MLCommons organizations](https://mlcommons.org) and [cKnowledge.org](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cknowledge)*.
