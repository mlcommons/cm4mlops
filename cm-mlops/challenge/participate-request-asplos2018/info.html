<h3>Goals</h3>

Our long-term goal is to develop a common methodology and framework for
reproducible co-design of the efficient software/hardware stack for
emerging algorithms requested by our advisory board (inference, object
detection, training, etc) in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, size,
complexity, costs and other metrics.

Open REQUEST competitions bring together AI, ML and systems researchers
to share complete algorithm implementations (code and data) as <a
href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">portable</a>,
customizable and reusable
<a href="https://cknow.io/programs">Collective Knowledge
workflows</a>.

This helps other researchers and end-users to quickly validate such
results, reuse workflows and optimize/autotune algorithms across different
platforms, models, data sets, libraries, compilers and tools.

We will also use our practical experience reproducing experimental results
from REQUEST submissions to help set up artifact evaluation at the
upcoming <a href="https://mlsys.cc">MLSys</a>, and to suggest new
algorithms for the inclusion to the <a href="https://mlperf.org">MLPerf
benchmark</a>.

<h3>Long-term goals</h3>

Developing efficient software and hardware for emerging
workloads and optimizing it in terms of speed, accuracy,
                  costs and other metrics is extremely complex and time
                  consuming. Furthermore, the lack of common
                  infrastructure and rigorous methodology for reproducible
                  evaluation and multi-objective optimization makes
                  it even more challenging to validate and compare
                  different published works across numerous and
                  continuously changing platforms, software frameworks,
                  compilers, libraries, algorithms, data sets, and
                  environments.

<br>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06378">ReQuEST</a>
                  is aimed at providing a scalable tournament framework,
                  a common experimental methodology and an open repository
                  for continuous evaluation and optimization of the
                  quality vs. efficiency Pareto optimality of a wide range
                  of real-world applications, libraries and models across
                  the whole hardware/software stack on complete platforms.
                  In contrast with other (deep learning) benchmarking
                  challenges where experimental results are submitted in
                  a form of JSON, CSV or XLS files, ReQuESTparticipants
                  will be asked to submit a complete <i>workflow
                  artifact</i> in a unified and automated form (i.e. not
                  just some ad-hoc Docker/VM image) which encompasses
                  toolchains, frameworks, algorithm, libraries, and target
                  hardware platform; any of which can be fine-tuned,
                  or customized at will by the participant to implement
                  their optimization technique. <br> Such open
                  infrastructure helps to bring together multidisciplinary
                  researchers in systems, compilers, architecture and
                  machine learning to develop and share their algorithms,
                  tools and techniques as portable, customizable and
                  "plug&play" components with a common API.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We then arrange open REQUEST competitions
                  on Pareto-efficient co-design of the whole
                  software/hardware stack to continuously optimize such
                  algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, costs
                  and other metrics across diverse inputs and platforms
                  from IoT to supercomputers.
              </p>
              <p>
                  All benchmarking results and winning SW/HW/model
                  configurations will be visualized on a <a
                  href="https://cKnowledge.org/results">public SOTA
                  leaderboard</a> and grouped according to certain
                  categories (e.g.embedded vs. server). The winning
                  artifacts will be discoverable via <a
                  href="https://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a>
                  to help the community reproduce, reuse, improve and
                  compare against them thanks to the common experimental
                  framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We hope that our approach will help automate research and accelerate innovation!

              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Open tournament framework goal</h3>
              <p>
                  REQUEST promotes reproducibility of experimental results
                  and reusability/customization of research artifacts
                  by standardizing evaluation methodologies and
                  facilitating the deployment of efficient solutions
                  on heterogeneous platforms. That is why we build our
                  competition on top of an open-source and portable
                  workflow framework (<a
                  href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective
                  Knowledge or CK</a>) and a <a
                  href="http://cTuning.org/ae">standard artifact
                  evaluation methodology</a> from premier ACM systems
                  conferences (CGO, PPoPP, PACT, SuperComputing)
                  to provide unified evaluation and a real-time
                  leader-board of submissions.
              </p>


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Metrics and Pareto-optimality goals</h3>
              <p> REQUEST promotes quality-awareness to the architecture and systems community, and resource-awareness to the applications community and end-users.
                  <br>
                  The submissions and their evaluation metrics will
                  be maintained in a public repository that includes
                  a live leader board. Specific attention will be brought
                  to submissions close to a Pareto frontier in
                  a multi-dimensional space of accuracy, execution time,
                  power/energy consumption, hardware/code/model footprint,
                  monetary costs etc.
              </p>
                  <!-- Eventually we may want to converge on a few meaningful metrics to assess quality on a per-application basis, and efficiency on a per-platform basis. -->


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Application goals</h3>
              <p>
                  In the long term, REQUEST will cover a comprehensive
                  suite of workloads, datasets and models covering
                  applications domains that are most relevant
                  to researchers in academia and industry (AI, vision,
                  robotics, quantum computing, scientific computing, etc).
                  This suite will evolve according to feedback and
                  contributions from the community thus substituting
                  ad-hoc, artificial, quickly outdated
                  or non-representative benchmarks. Furthermore, all
                  artifacts from this suite can be automatically plugged
                  in to the REQUEST competition workflows to simplify,
                  automate and accelerate systems research.
              </p>
              <p>
                  For the first iteration of REQUEST at ASPLOS'18,
                  we focus on Deep Learning. Our first step is to provide
                  coverage for the <a
                  href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> image
                  classification challenge. Restricting the competition
                  to a single application domain will allow us to prepare
                  an open-source tournament infrastructure and validate
                  it across multiple hardware platforms, deep learning
                  frameworks, libraries, models and inputs. For future
                  incarnations of ReQuEST, we will provide broader
                  application coverage, based on the interests of the
                  research community and the direction set by our
                  industrial board.
              </p>
              <p> Though our main focus is on end-to-end applications,
              we also plan to allow future submissions for (micro)kernels
              such as matrix multiply, convolutions and transfer functions
              to facilitate participation from the compilers and computer
              architecture community.</p>

                  <!-- However, we will provide a separate scoreboard for such submissions. -->


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Complete platforms goals</h3>
              <p>REQUEST aims at covering a comprehensive set of hardware
              systems from data-centers down to sensory nodes,
              incorporating various forms of processors including GPUs,
              DSPs, FPGAs, neuromorphic and even analogue accelerators
              in the long term.</p>

              <p>In general, we want to encourage participants to target accessible, off-the-shelf hardware to allow our artifact evaluation committee to conveniently reproduce their results. Example systems include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Server-class: AWS/Azure cloud instance, any x86-based desktop system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mobile-class: Any Arm-based (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Raspberry Pi 3, Xilinx PYNQ board), or Intel-Atom-based SoC development board, Android-based smartphone or tablets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   IoT-class: Low-power Arm micro-controllers (e.g. Freescale FRDM KL03 Development Board).
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>If a submission relies on an exotic hardware platform, the participants can either provide restricted access to their evaluation platform to the artifact evaluation committee, or at least notify in advance (at least 3 weeks notice) the organizers of their choice so that a similar platform can be acquired in time (assuming costs are not prohibitive).</p>

                  <!-- <p>We plan to certify 1-2 power analyzers supported by our evaluation framework. The organizing committee may use a high-precision power analyzer (e.g. Yokogawa WT310 used for LPIRC costing $3,000-4,000) to calibrate a low-cost power analyzer (e.g. Hardkernel SmartPower2 costing $37), and use the calibration results when determining the winners. -->

              <p>In the longer term, we also plan to provide support for simulator-based evaluations for architecture/micro-architecture research.</p>

                  <!-- Simulator-based research will be presented in a separate leaderboard with meta-performance models to extrapolate public simulation results to real systems and help refine models used in simulators. When validated, we can "promote" simulation results to the main scoreboard. -->


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Unified submission goal</h3>
              <p>
                  Authors need to submit a short document briefly describing their novel optimization technique or referencing already published paper, and providing a detailed specification of the experimental workflow including all related artifacts, evaluation methodology, and improved metrics to compete with other submissions.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i class="alert-danger">Note that novelty of the implemented techniques is not a requirement!
                  We actually strongly encourage artifact submissions of already published techniques for which artifacts don't exist yet.
                  We will independently reproduce them to prepare an open set of reference implementations of popular algorithms/frameworks/optimizations in a form of portable and customizable workflows which can be easily reused and build upon!</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                  We want to unify every submission to enable fair evaluation.
                  That is why we decided to use the open-source <a href="https://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge workflow framework (CK)</a>.
                  CK helps <a href="https://cknowledge.org/partners.html">the community</a> share artifacts (models, data sets, libraries, tools) as reusable and customizable components with a common JSON API and meta description.
                  CK also helps to implement portable workflows which can <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">adapt to a user environment</a> on Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.
                  <a href="https://acm.org">ACM</a> currently <a href="https://dl.acm.org/reproducibility.cfm">evaluates CK</a> to enabling sharing of reusable and portable artifacts in an ACM Digital Library.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <a href="https://cTuning.org">Non-profit cTuning foundation</a> will help authors convert their artifacts and experimental scripts to the CK format during evaluation while reusing AI artifacts already shared by the community in the CK format (see <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos#user-content-shared-workflows">CK AI repositories</a>,
                  <a href="https://cknow.io/modules">CK modules (wrappers)</a>,
                  <a href="https://cknow.io/soft">CK software detection plugins</a>,
                  <a href="https://cknow.io/packages">portable CK packages</a>).
                  Authors can also try to convert their workflows to the CK format themselves using the distinguished artifact from ACM CGO'17 as an example (see <a href="https://github.com/SamAinsworth/reproduce-cgo2017-paper">Artifact repository at GitHub</a>,
                  <a href="https://ctuning.org/ae/submission_extra.html">Artifact Appendix</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Artifact-sharing">CK notes</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">CK portable workflows</a>) though the learning curve is still quite steep - we plan to prepare CK tutorials based on feeback from the participants.

              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Open evaluation and live leader board goals</h3>
              <p>
                  REQUEST is backed by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility">ACM Task Force on Data, Software, and Reproducibility in Publication</a> and will use the standard <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">ACM artifact evaluation methodology</a>.
                  Artifact evaluation will be single blind (see <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">PPoPP, CGO, PACT, RTSS and SuperComputing</a>), and the reviews can be made public (see <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org/submission2016.html">ADAPT</a>) upon the authors' request.
                  Quality and efficiency metrics will be collected for each submission, and compiled on the <a href="https://cknow.io/c/result/pareto-efficient-ai-co-design-tournament-request-acm-asplos-2018">REQUEST live scoreboard</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  REQUEST will not determine a single winner, as collapsing all of the metrics into one single metric across all platforms will result in over-engineered solutions.
                  Instead, each REQUEST tournament will expose a set of quality, performance and efficiency metrics to perform optimizations on.
              </p>


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Open dissemination goals (REQUEST workshops)</h3>
              <p>
                  We will organize REQUEST workshops associated with tournaments to let authors present and discuss their most efficient algorithms.
                  We will also use workshops as an open forum to discuss how to improve our common reproducible methodology and framework for SW/HW co-design of emerging workloads with a broad academic and industrial community!
              </p>
              <p>
                  Solutions do not have to be on the Pareto frontier to be accepted for such workshops and the open REQUEST repository - a submission can be praised for its originality, reproducibility, adaptability, scalability, portability, ease of use, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                  However, reproducible submissions on the Pareto frontier will have an option to be published in the ACM Digital Library with <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM available, reusable and replicated badges</a>.
                  This will make them discoverable via ACM DL search engine — you can check this new feature yourself (since 2018) by selecting "Artifact Badge" for field and then select any badge you wish in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/advsearch.cfm?coll=DL&dl=ACM">ACM DL advanced search</a>!

              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Advisory/industrial board goal</h3>
              <p>
                  Members of the REQUEST advisory/industrial board will look over and comment on the results of our tournaments and workshops, collaborate on a common methodology for reproducible evaluation and optimization, suggest realistic workloads for future tournaments, arrange access to rare hardware to Artifact Evaluation Committee, and provide prizes for the most efficient solutions.
              </p>


              <h3 class="pt-3 pt-lg-5">Open research goal</h3>
              <p>
                  REQUEST attempts to put systems researchers, application engineers and end-users on the same ground by providing a common and portable evaluation framework while sharing all artifacts and optimization results in an open and reproducible way.
                  We expect that our open repository with customizable, reusable and optimized artifacts will be useful for
