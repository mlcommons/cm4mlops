# CM MLOps repository 

[![CM repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Collective%20Mind-compatible-blue)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm)
[![CM artifact](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifact-automated%20and%20reusable-blue)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm)

This repository contains [portable scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script) 
in the [CM format](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) to unify and interconnect 
different MLOps and DevOps tools.

All such components have a unified API, human readable CLI and extensible JSON/YAML meta description
making it possible to reuse them in different projects and chain them together 
into powerful, efficient and portable automation workflows, applications and web services
adaptable to continuously changing software and hardware.

We use and extend this repository in the [open education workgroup](../docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
as a common playground and a common language to help researchers and engineers
learn how to modularize complex software systems (such as AI and ML) 
and automate their benchmarking, optimization, co-design and deployment.

Read about the CM concept [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) 
and follow [this tutorial](../cm/docs/tutorial-scripts.md) 
to install CM framework and understand CM concepts.
