This repository contains automation recipes to run native MLOps and DevOps scripts and tools via a simple, common and human-readable
[CM interface](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) on any platform with any software stack.

All Ð¡M scripts have a simple Python API, extensible JSON/YAML meta description
and unifed input/output to make them reusable in different projects either individually 
or by chaining them together into powerful, efficient and portable automation workflows, 
applications and web services adaptable to continuously changing models, data sets, software and hardware
(see [CM workflow/pipeline for MLPerf inference](script/app-mlperf-inference/_cm.yaml) as example).

These automation recipes are being developed and maintained by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](../docs/taskforce.md)
with [great contributions](../CONTRIBUTING.md) from the community and important feedback from Google, AMD, Neural Magic, OctoML, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Dell, HPE, 
Red Hat, Intel, TTA, One Stop Systems, ACM and other organizations.
