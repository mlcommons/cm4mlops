This MLCommons CM repository contains portable scripts
in the [CM (CK2) format](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) to unify and interconnect 
different MLOps and DevOps tools acrossd diverse software and hardware stacks.
See the catalog [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script).

All cross-platform Ð¡M scripts have a unified API, human readable CLI and extensible JSON/YAML meta description
making it possible to reuse them in different projects and chain them together 
into powerful, efficient and portable automation workflows, applications and web services
adaptable to continuously changing software and hardware.

Check [this page](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) to read about the MLCommons CK concept,
install MLCommons CM automation meta-framework (2nd implementation of the CK concept)
and reuse portable CM scripts for MLOps and DevOps.

Join the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](../docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
to learn how to run and optimize MLPerf benchmarks, modularize complex AI and ML systems 
and automate their benchmarking, optimization, co-design and deployment using the MLCommons CM framework 
and portable CM scripts.
