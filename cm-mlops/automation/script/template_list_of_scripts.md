This is an automatically generated list of portable and reusable automation recipes (CM scripts)
with a [human-friendly interface (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) 
to run a growing number of ad-hoc MLPerf, MLOps, and DevOps scripts
from [MLCommons projects](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script)
and [research papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4) 
in a unified way on any operating system with any software and hardware
natively or inside containers.

Click on any automation recipe below to learn how to run and reuse it 
via CM command line, Python API or GUI.

*CM is a community project being developed and extended by [MLCommons members and individual contributors](../CONTRIBUTING.md) -
 you can find source code of CM scripts maintained by MLCommons [here](../cm-mlops/script).
