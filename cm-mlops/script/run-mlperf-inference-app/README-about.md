This is a ready-to-use CM automation recipe that provides a unified and portable interface to the MLPerf inference benchmark 
assembled from other [portable CM scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md)
being developed by the open [MLCommons taskforce on automation and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md).

This automation recipe automatically generates the command line for the [universal MLPerf inference script](../app-mlperf-inference)
to run MLPerf scenarios for a given ML task, model, runtime and device, and prepare and validate submissions.
