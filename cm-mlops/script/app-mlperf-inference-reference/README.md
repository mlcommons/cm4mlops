# About

This portable CM script is being developed by the [MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to modularize the *python reference implementations* of the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference) 
using the [MLCommons CM automation meta-framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck).
The goal is to make it easier to run, optimize and reproduce MLPerf benchmarks 
across diverse platforms with continuously changing software and hardware.
