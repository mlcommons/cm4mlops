# Portable and reusable CM scripts 

These portable and reusable CM scripts are being developed by the 
[MLCommons taskforce on automation and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md) 
to make native scripts and tools more interoperable, reusable, portable, deterministic and reproducible
across rapidly evolving software, hardware, models and data.
