### About

These automation recipes wrap native MLOps and DevOps scripts and tools to unify them and run them 
via a simple, common and human-readable [CM interface](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) 
on any platform with any software stack.

They are being developed and maintained by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](../../docs/taskforce.md)
with [great contributions](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) from the community and important feedback from Google, AMD, Neural Magic, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Dell, HPE, 
Red Hat, Intel, TTA, One Stop Systems, ACM and other organizations.

See the automatically generated catalog [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md).
