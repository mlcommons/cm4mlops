# KB: MLOps and MLPerf

One of our goals is to automate the development, optimization and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems in production. 
The main challenge is how to support numerous and continuously changing software and hardware. 
Here we collect related notes about MLPerf, MLOps, DevOps, inference engines, containers and production deployment of ML systems.
