# Introduction to the MLCommons CM language

CM is a simple, technology-agnostic, and English-like scripting language
powered by Python, JSON and/or YAML meta descriptions, and a unified CLI.
It is being developed by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md)
to help researchers and practitioners describe, share, and reproduce experimental results 
in a unified and portable way across any rapidly evolving software, hardware, and data.

See a few real-world examples of using CM scripting language:
- [README to reproduce published IPOL'22 paper](cm-mlops/script/app-ipol-reproducibility-2022-439)
- [README to reproduce MLPerf RetinaNet inference benchmark at Student Cluster Competition'22](docs/tutorials/sc22-scc-mlperf.md)
- [Auto-generated READMEs to reproduce official MLPerf BERT inference benchmark v3.0 submission with a model from the Hugging Face Zoo](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_inference_3.0/tree/main/open/cTuning/code/huggingface-bert/README.md)
