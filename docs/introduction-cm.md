## Introduction to the MLCommons CM language

*Check [our recent keynote at ACM REP'23: "toward a common language to facilitate reproducible research and technology transfer: challenges and solutions"]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339 ).*


During the past 10 years, the community has considerably improved 
the reproducibility of experimental results from research projects and published papers
by introducing the [artifact evaluation process](https://cTuning.org/ae) 
with a [unified artifact appendix and reproducibility checklists](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/artifact-evaluation/checklist.md), 
Jupyter notebooks, containers, and Git repositories. 

On the other hand, [our experience reproducing more than 150 papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
revealed that it still takes weeks and months of painful and
repetitive interactions between researchers and evaluators to reproduce experimental results. 

This effort includes decrypting numerous README files, examining ad-hoc artifacts 
and containers, and figuring out how to reproduce computational results.
Furthermore, snapshot containers pose a challenge to optimize algorithms' performance, 
accuracy, power consumption and operational costs across diverse 
and rapidly evolving software, hardware, and data used in the real world.

This practical experience and the feedback from the community motivated 
us to establish the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md)
and develop a light-weight, technology agnostic, and English-like 
workflow automation language called Collective Mind (MLCommons CM).

This language provides a common, non-intrusive and human-readable interface to any software project 
transforming it into a collection of [reusable automation recipes (CM scripts)]( https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script ).
Following [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles), CM automation actions and scripts 
are simple wrappers around existing user scripts and artifacts to make them
* findable via human-readable tags, aliases and unique IDs;
* accessible via a unified CM CLI and Python API with JSON/YAML meta descriptions;
* interoperable and portable across any software, hardware, models and data;
* reusable across all projects.

CM is written in simple Python and uses JSON and/or YAML meta descriptions with a unified CLI
to minimize the learning curve and help researchers and practitioners describe, share, and reproduce experimental results 
in a unified, portable, and automated way across any rapidly evolving software, hardware, and data
while solving the "dependency hell" and automatically generating unified README files and modular containers.

Our ultimate goal is to use CM language to facilitate reproducible research for AI, ML and systems projects, 
minimize manual and repetitive benchmarking and optimization efforts, 
and reduce time and costs when transferring technology to production
across continuously changing software, hardware, models, and data.
