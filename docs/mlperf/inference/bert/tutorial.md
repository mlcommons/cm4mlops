# Tutorial: modularizing and automating MLPerf Inference Language Processing model bert



# Introduction

It should take less than an hour to complete this tutorial. In the end, you should obtain a tarball (`mlperf_submission.tar.gz`) with the MLPerf-compatible results.

*Note that both MLPerf and CM automation are evolving projects.

# System preparation

## Minimal system requirements

* CPU: 1 node (x86-64 or Arm64)
* OS: we have tested this automation on Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 10, Red Hat 9 and MacOS 13
* Disk space: 
  - ~ 10GB
* Python: 3.8+
* All other dependencies (artifacts and tools) will be installed by the CM meta-framework

## MLCommons CM automation meta-framework

The MLCommons is developing an open-source and technology-neutral 
[Collective Mind meta-framework (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck)
to modularize ML Systems and automate their benchmarking, optimization 
and design space exploration across continuously changing software, hardware and data.

CM is the second generation of the [MLCommons CK workflow automation framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf) 
that was originally developed to make it easier to [reproduce research papers at ML and Systems conferences](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility).
The goal is to help researchers unify and automate all the steps to prepare and run MLPerf and other benchmarks
across diverse ML models, datasets, frameworks, compilers and hardware (see [HPCA'22 presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6475385) about our motivation).



## CM installation

Follow [this guide](../installation.md) to install the MLCommons CM framework on your system.

After the installation, you should be able to access the CM command line as follows:

```bash
$ cm

cm {action} {automation} {artifact(s)} {--flags} @input.yaml @input.json
```

cm --version
```

```txt
1.5.3
```

## Pull CM repository with cross-platform MLOps and DevOps scripts

Pull stable MLCommons CM repository with [cross-platform CM scripts for modular ML Systems](../list_of_scripts.md):

```bash
cm pull repo mlcommons@ck
```

CM pulls all such repositories into the `$HOME/CM` directory to search for CM automations and artifacts.
You can find the location of a pulled repository as follows:

```bash
cm find repo mlcommons@ck
```

## Setup a virtual environment for Python

```bash
cm run script "install python-venv" --name=mlperf
export CM_SCRIPT_EXTRA_CMD="--adr.python.name=mlperf"
```

## Install system dependencies for your platform

First, you need to install various system dependencies required by the MLPerf inference benchmark.

For this purpose, we have created a cross-platform CM script that will automatically install 
such dependencies based on your OS (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, MacOS ...). 

In this case, CM script serves simply as a wrapper with a unified and cross-platform interface
for native scripts that you can find and extend [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script/get-sys-utils-cm)
if some dependencies are missing on your machine - this is a collaborative way to make 
CM scripts portable and interoperable.

You can run this CM scripts as follows (note that you may be asked for a SUDO password on your platform):

```bash
cm run script "get sys-utils-cm" --quiet
```

If you think that you have all system dependencies installed,
you can run this script without `--quiet` flag and type "skip" in the script prompt.


## Use CM to detect or install Python 3.8+

Since we use Python reference implementation of the MLPerf inference benchmark (unoptimized),
we need to detect or install Python 3.8+ (MLPerf requirement). 

You need to detect it using the following [CM script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md#get-python3):

```bash
cm run script "get python" --version_min=3.8
```

Note, that all artifacts (including the above scripts) in MLCommons CM are organized as a database of interconnected components.
They can be found either by their user friendly tags (such as `get,python`) or aliases (`get-python3`) and unique identifiers
(`5b4e0237da074764`).
You can find this information in a [CM meta description of this script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/cm-mlops/script/get-python3/_cm.json).

If required Python is installed on your system, CM will detect it and cache related environment variables such as PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc.
to be reused by other CM scripts. You can find an associated CM cache entry for your python as follows:

```bash
cm show cache --tags=get,python
```

You can see the environment variables produced by this CM script in the following JSON file:
```bash
cat `cm find cache --tags=get,python`/cm-cached-state.json
```

If required Python is not detected, CM will automatically attempt to download and build it from sources 
using another [cross-platform CM script "install-python-src"](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md#install-python-src).
In the end, CM will also cache new binaries and related environment variables such as PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc:

```bash
cm show cache
```

You can find installed binaries and reuse them in your own project with or without CM as follows:
```bash
cm find cache --tags=install,python
```

Note that if you run the same script again, CM will automatically find and reuse the cached output:
```bash
cm run script "get python" --version_min=3.8 --out=json
```

## Pull MLPerf inference sources

You should now download and cache the MLPerf inference sources using the following command:

```bash
cm run script "get mlperf inference src"
```

## Compile MLPerf loadgen

You need to compile loadgen from the above inference sources while forcing compiler dependency to GCC:


```bash
cm run script "get mlperf loadgen" --adr.compiler.tags=gcc
```

The `--adr` flag stands for "Add to all Dependencies Recursively" and will find all sub-dependencies on other CM scripts 
in the CM loadgen script with the "compiler" name and will append "gcc" tag 
to enforce detection and usage of GCC to build loadgen.

# CM automation for the MLPerf benchmark

## MLPerf inference - Python - Bert FP32 - SQUAD v1.1 - ONNX - CPU - Offline

### Download the SQuAD dataset


```bash
cm run script "get dataset squad original"
```

After installing this dataset via CM, you can reuse it in your own projects or other CM scripts (including MLPerf benchmarks).
You can check the CM cache as follows (the unique ID of the CM cache entry will be different on your machine):
```bash
cm show cache --tags=get,dataset,squad,original
```

```txt

* Tags: dataset,get,language-processing,original,script-artifact-6651c119c3ae49b3,squad,validation,version-1.1
  Path: /home/arjun/CM/repos/local/cache/e5ac8a524ba64d09
  Version: 1.1
```



### Install ONNX runtime for CPU

Now detect or install ONNX Python runtime (targeting CPU) your system
using a [generic CM script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md#get-generic-python-lib) to install python package:

```bash
cm run script "get generic-python-lib _onnxruntime"
```





### Download Bert-large model (FP32, ONNX format)

Download and cache this [reference model](https://paperswithcode.com/model/resnext?variant=resnext-50-32x4d) in the ONNX format (float32)
using the following [CM script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md#get-ml-model-retinanet):

```bash
cm run script "get ml-model language-processing bert-large _onnx"
```

It takes around ~1GB of disk space. You can find it in the CM cache as follows:

```bash
cm show cache --tags=get,ml-model,bert-large,_onnx
```

```txt

*Tags: bert,bert-large,bert-squad,get,language,language-processing,ml-model,raw,script-artifact-5e865dbdc65949d2,_amazon-s3,_fp32,_onnx
  Path: /home/arjun/CM/repos/local/cache/8727a38b72aa4b3f
```

### Run reference MLPerf inference benchmark (offline, accuracy)

You are now ready to run the [reference (unoptimized) Python implementation](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/vision/classification_and_detection/python) 
of the MLPerf vision benchmark with [ONNX backend](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/blob/master/vision/classification_and_detection/python/backend_onnxruntime.py).

Normally, you would need to go through this [README.md](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/vision/classification_and_detection)
and prepare all the dependencies and environment variables manually.

The [CM "app-mlperf-inference" script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md#app-mlperf-inference)
allows you to run this benchmark as follows:

```bash
cm run script "app mlperf inference generic _python _bert-99 _onnxruntime _cpu" \
     --scenario=Offline \
     --mode=accuracy \
     --test_query_count=10 \
     --rerun
```

This CM script will automatically find or install all dependencies
described in its [CM meta description](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/cm-mlops/script/app-mlperf-inference/_cm.yaml),
aggregate all environment variables, preprocess all files and assemble the MLPerf benchmark CMD. After running the benchmark, it calls the MLPerf accuracy script to evaluate the accuracy of the results. 

It will take a few minutes to run it and you should see the following accuracy:

```txt
{"exact_match": 70.0, "f1": 70.0}
Reading examples...
No cached features at 'eval_features.pickle'... converting from examples...
Creating tokenizer...
Converting examples to features...
Caching features at 'eval_features.pickle'...
Loading LoadGen logs...
Post-processing predictions..

```

Congratulations, you can now play with this benchmark using the unified CM commands!

Note that even if did not install all the above dependencies manually, the below command
will automatically install all the necessary dependencies.

You can check it by cleaning the CM cache and executing this command again 

```bash
cm rm cache -f

cm run script "app mlperf inference generic _python _bert-99 _onnxruntime _cpu" \
     --adr.python.version_min=3.8 \
     --adr.compiler.tags=gcc \
     --scenario=Offline \
     --mode=accuracy \
     --test_query_count=10 \
     --quiet \
     --rerun
```


### Run MLPerf inference benchmark (offline, performance)

Let's run the MLPerf object detection while measuring performance:

```bash
cm run script "app mlperf inference generic _python _bert-99 _onnxruntime _cpu" \
     --scenario=Offline \
     --mode=performance \
     --rerun
```

It will run for a few seconds and you should see an output similar to the following one at the end
(the QPS is the performance result of this benchmark that depends on the speed of your system):

```txt

```

Note that QPS is very low because we use an unoptimized reference implementation of this benchmark on CPU.



### Prepare MLPerf submission

You are now ready to generate the submission similar to the ones appearing
on the [official MLPerf inference dashboard](https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-edge-21).

We have developed another script that runs the MLPerf inference benchmark in both accuracy and performance mode,
runs the submission checker, unifies output for a dashboard and creates a valid MLPerf submission pack in `open.tar.gz` 
with all required MLPerf logs and stats.

You can run this script as follows (just substitute *OctoML* with the name of your organization):

```bash
cm run script --tags=run,mlperf,inference,generate-run-cmds,_submission,_short \
      --submitter="Community" \
      --hw_name=default \
      --implementation=reference \
      --model=bert-99 \
      --backend=onnxruntime \
      --device=cpu \
      --scenario=Offline \
      --test_query_count=10 \
      --clean
```      

It will take a few minutes to run and you should see the following output in the end:

```

Note that `--clean` flag cleans all previous runs of MLPerf benchmark to make sure that the MLPerf submission script picks up the latest results.

You will also see the following 3 files in your current directory:
```
ls -l
mlperf_submission.tar.gz
summary.csv
summary.json
```

You should submit these files to the organizing committee to get extra points in the Student Cluster Competition.

Note that by default, CM-MLPerf will store the raw results 
in `$HOME/mlperf_submission` (with truncated accuracy logs) and in `$HOME/mlperf_submission_logs` 
(with complete and very large accuracy logs).

You can change this directory using the flag `--submission_dir={directory to store raw MLPerf results}`
in the above script.
