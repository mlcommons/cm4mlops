# CM (CK2) documentation

[Collective Knowledge concept (CK)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf) 
provides a simple way to unify, manage, connect and reuse any artifacts, scripts, tools and workflows 
on any platform with any software and hardware stack. It is motivated by our 
[tedious experience](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility) 
reproducing research papers on machine learning and systems and validating them in the real world.

Collective Mind workflow automation meta-framework (CM aka CK2) is the 2nd implementation 
of the CK concept being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to make MLOps and DevOps more interoperable, portable, deterministic and reproducible.

[MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org) uses CM to to modularize ML and AI systems and automate their benchmarking, 
optimization and deployment across continuously changing software, hardware and data.
