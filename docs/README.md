# CM documentation

Collective Mind (CM) is a lightweight, non-intrusive and technology-agnostic workflow automation framework 
being developed by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
based on the feedback from the [the community, MLCommons members and individual contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The goal is to provide a common, simple and human-readable interface to manage, run, reproduce 
and customize diverse AI/ML apps, benchmarks and research projects across continuously changing
models, datasets, software and hardware from different vendors in a unified and automated way.
