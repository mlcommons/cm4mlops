# Documentation

Collective Knowledge project consists of several sub-projects being developed by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md) and the community:

* [Collective Mind automation language (CM)](#collective-mind-automation-language-cm)
* [CM automation for Artifact Evaluation](https://github.com/ctuning/cm-reproduce-research-projects)
* [Modular Inference Library (MIL)](#modular-inference-library-mil)
* [Collective Knowledge Playground (CK)](#collective-knowledge-playground-ck) 


The goal is to help the community make it easier to reproduce research projects, 
automate benchmarking and optimization of AI/ML systems,
and simplify transfer of research ideas to production across rapidly evolving software, hardware and data.

See the [ACM REP'23 keynote](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339) and [MLPerf submitters orientation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8144274)
for more details.

The development is led by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin) and [Arjun Suresh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunsuresh).
