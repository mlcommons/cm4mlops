# Collective Knowledge v1 and v2

The [open-source Collective Knowledge Technology v1 and v2 (CK)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149) 
was originally developed by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin) 
based on his practical experience helping the community set up 
[reproducibility initiatives at compiler, systems and ML conferences](https://cTuning.org/ae),
rerun numerous experiments from published papers and validate them in the real world 
across diverse and continuously changing models, data sets, software and hardware since 2013:
see the [ACM TechTalk'21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4) for more details.

The original development of CK v1 and v2 was sponsorted by [cTuning.org](https://cTuning.org), 
[HiPEAC](https://hipeac.net) and [OctoML](https://octoml.ai).

The archive of this discontinued framework is available in the [/ck directory](../ck). 

# MLCommons Collective Mind

Grigori donated the CK technology to [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org) in 2022 to benefit everyone and helped establish
the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md) co-led with [Arjun Suresh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunsuresh).

This community project is now officially supported, developed and maintained by [MLCommons.org](https://mlcommons.org)
with the help from [cKnowledge.org](https://cKnowledge.org) and [cTuning.org](https://cTuning.org).

Please go to this [GitHub page](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) to learn more about this project
and check [the slides from ACM REP'23 keynote about CM](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339).
