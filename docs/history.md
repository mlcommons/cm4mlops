# Collective Knowledge v1 and v2 (CK)

The [open-source Collective Knowledge Technology v1 and v2 (CK)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0211) 
was originally developed by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin) 
with great contributions from [the community](../ck/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

CK was based on Grigori's practical experience helping the community [reproduce many research projects 
and validate them in the real world](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility)
across diverse and continuously changing models, data sets, software and hardware since 2013.

CK development was also sponsored by the [cTuning foundation](https://cTuning.org/ae), 
[HiPEAC](https://hipeac.net) and [OctoML](https://octoml.ai).

The archive of this discontinued framework is available in the [/ck directory](../ck). 

# MLCommons Collective Mind (CM)

Grigori donated the CK technology to [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org) in 2022 to benefit everyone,
prototyped a new version of CK called [Collective Mind (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm) 
with [portable and reusable automation recipes for universal benchmarking and optimization of applications
and systems (CM scripts)](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts),
and helped establish the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md)
co-led with Arjun Suresh.

We continue extending CM to support different MLCommons projects to modularize and unify benchmarking
of ML/AI systems as a collaborative engineering effort based on [user feedback](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can learn more about the CM concept and motivation from the [keynote at ACM REP'23](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339).
