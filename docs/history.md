# Collective Knowledge v1 and v2

The open-source Collective Knowledge Technology v1 and v2 was originally developed by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin) 
based on his tedious experience introducing reproducibility initiatives at ML and Systems conferences and helping the community
reproduce research results from hundreds of published papers and validated them in the real world since 2013.
You can find more details in the [ACM TechTalk'21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4) and [CK concepts overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149).

The original development of CK v1 and v2 was sponsorted by [cTuning.org](https://cTuning.org), [HiPEAC](https://hipeac.net) and [OctoML](https://octoml.ai).

The archive of this discontinued framework is available in the [/ck directory](../ck). 

# MLCommons Collective Mind

Grigori donated the CK technology to MLCommons in 2022 to benefit everyone and help establish
the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md) co-led with [Arjun Suresh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunsuresh)
to develop a new version from scratch based on the feedback from the community and MLCommons members.

As an outcome of this fruitful collaboration and thanks to the [community contributions](../CONTRIBUTING.md) 
and very useful suggestions from Google, AMD, Neural Magic, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Dell, HPE, Red Hat,
Intel, TTA, One Stop Systems and other organizations, 
we have developed a new [Collective Mind workflow automation language (MLCommons CM)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339)
as a very lightweight, non-intrusive and technology-agnostic workflow automation framework that provides a common, simple 
and human-readable interface to manage, run, reproduce and customize different implementations of MLPerf benchmarks
across continuously changing models, datasets, software and hardware from different vendors:
[github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf).

We also help ML and Systems conferences use CM interface to automate and simplify [artifact evaluation and reproducibility initiatives](https://cTuning.org/ae).

This community now officially supported, developed and maintained by [MLCommons.org](https://mlcommons.org)
with the help from [cKnowledge.org](https://cKnowledge.org) and [cTuning.org](https://cTuning.org).
