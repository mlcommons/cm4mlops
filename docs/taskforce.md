# MLCommons Taskforce on Automation and Reproducibility

## Goals

* Automatically run any MLPerf benchmark out-of-the-box with any software, hardware, model and data from any vendor: 
  *[prototype is available and validated during MLPerf inf v3.0 submission](../cm-mlops/challenge/optimize-mlperf-inference-v3.1-2023/README.md)*.
* Automate optimization experiments and visualization of results with derived metrics: *[prototype](https://cknowledge.org/mlcommons-inference-gui)*.
* Generate Pareto-optimal end-to-end applications based on reproducible MLPerf results: *under development*.
* Organize reproducibility, replicability and optimization challenges to improve MLPerf results across diverse software, hardware, models and data: 
  *[on-going](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/challenge) 
  (see adopted terminology [here](artifact-evaluation/faq.md#what-is-the-difference-between-repeatability-reproducibility-and-replicability))*.


## Mission

This public taskforce is developing a free, open-source and technology-agnostic on-prem 
Collective Knowledge platform (MLCommons CK playground)
together with a portable Collective Mind automation language (MLCommons CM) - see [CK and CM documentation](README.md) 
for more details.

Our goal is to help the community benchmark, optimize and compare AI, ML and other emerging applications
across diverse and rapidly evolving software, hardware, models and data from different vendors
in a unified, collaborative, automated and reproducible way using the common CM language.

We are also organizing [reproducibility, replicability and optimization challenges](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges)
powered by the common CM language and CK playground to reproduce results from research papers and MLPerf submissions, 
optimize them in terms of  performance, power consumption, accuracy, size, costs and other metrics, 
and validate them in the real-world applications.

For example, we thank [the community](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=contributors) for helping us to validate our CK&CM technology
during the [1st collaborative challenge to run MLPerf inference v3.0 benchmark](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges&name=optimize-mlperf-inference-v3.0-2023)
across diverse models, software and hardware from Neural Magic, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Microsoft, Amazon, Google,
Krai, cKnowledge, cTuning foundation, OctoML, Deelvin, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, Hugging Face and Apple - 
CK has helped automate more than 80% of all recent MLPerf inference benchmark submissions 
(and 98% of all power results), make them more reproducible and reusable,
and obtain record inference performance on the latest Qualcomm and Nvidia devices.

Our ultimate motivation for our CK technology is to help researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs 
accelerate innovation by automatically generating the most efficient, reproducible and deployable 
full-stack AI/ML applications using the most suitable software/hardware stack 
at any given time (model, framework, inference engine and any other related dependency) 
based on their requirements and constraints including costs, throughput, latency, power consumption, accuracy, target devices (cloud/edge/mobile/tiny), 
environment and data while slashing their development and operational costs.

## Development plan

### 2023

- [x] DONE: prototype the CM (CK2) automation to let the community submit MLPerf inference v3.0 results across any software and hardware stack 
      (our technology powered 4K+ results (!) across diverse cloud and edge platforms with different versions of PyTorch, ONNX, TFLite, TF, TVM targeting diverse CPUs and GPUs 
      that will be announced at the beginning of April)!
- [x] Prototype an [open-source on-prem CK platform](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/platform) 
      with a public API to automate SW/HW co-design for AI, ML and other emerging workloads based on user requirements and constraints.
- [x] [Collaborative CK challenge](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges&name=optimize-mlperf-inference-v3.0-2023) 
      for the community to reproduce, optimize and submit results to MLPerf inference v3.0
      - 98% of all results were automated by the MLCommons CK technology!
- [ ] [New CK challenge](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges&name=optimize-mlperf-inference-v3.1-2023) 
      to help MLCommons organizations and the community use our platform to prepare, optimize and compare their MLPerf inference v3.1 submissions on any SW/HW stack
- [ ] Enhance the MLCommons CK2/CM automation meta-framework to support our platform across any SW/HW stacks from MLCommons members and the community.
- [ ] Enhance the [MLPerf C++ inference template library (MITL)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script/app-mlperf-inference-cpp) 
      to run and optimize MLPerf inference across any AI/ML/SW/HW stack.
- [ ] Enhance the [light MLPerf inference application](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script/app-mlperf-inference-cpp) 
      to benchmark any ML model on any SW/HW stack without data sets and accuracy.
- [ ] Enhance our platform and automation framework to support [reproducibility initiatives and studies](https://cTuning.org/ae) at conferences and journals 
      across rapidly evolving software, hardware and data (collaboration with the [cTuning foundation](https://cTuning.org), ACM, IEEE and NeurIPS).


### 2022

- [x] DONE: [Prototype of the 2nd version of the MLCommons CK framework to solve the dependency hell and run any application on any hardware/software stack](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck).
- [x] DONE: [GUI prototype to run MLPerf inference benchmarks on any software and hardware](https://cknowledge.org/mlperf-inference-gui).
- [x] DONE: [GUI prototype to prepare MLPerf inference submission](https://cknowledge.org/mlperf-inference-submission-gui).
- [x] DONE: [GUI prototype to visualize AI/ML benchmarking results](https://cKnowledge.org/cm-gui-graph).
