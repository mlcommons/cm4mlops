# Tutorial: automate, visualize and reproduce Tiny MLPerf submissions

The [MLCommons task force on automation and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
is developing an [open-source Collective Knowledge platform](https://access.cKnowledge.org)
to make it easier for the community to run, visualize and optimize MLPerf benchmarks 
out of the box across diverse software, hardware, models and data.

This tutorial demonstrates how to run and/or reproduce Tiny MLPerf benchmark and prepare your own submission
for a [NUCLEO-L4R5ZI board from STMicroelectronics](https://estore.st.com/en/nucleo-l4r5zi-cpn.html)
based on a popular [microTVM compiler](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/topic/microtvm/index.html)
and with the help of the [MLCommons CM automation language](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/README.md).

Benchmark compilation and device flashing can be done on any Linux-based platform
while running benchmark using EEMBC GUI can be done on Linux and Windows.
