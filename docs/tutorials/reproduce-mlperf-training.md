# Tutorial: automate, visualize and reproduce MLPerf training submissions

The [MLCommons task force on automation and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
is developing an [open-source Collective Knowledge platform](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments&tags=mlperf-training)
to make it easier for the community to run, visualize and optimize MLPerf benchmarks 
out of the box across diverse software, hardware, models and data.

This tutorial demonstrates how to run and/or reproduce MLPerf training benchmark
with the help of the [MLCommons CM automation language](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/README.md).
