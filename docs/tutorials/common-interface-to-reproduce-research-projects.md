# Tutorial: Adding a common interface to reproduce research projects

## Motivation

While helping the community to reproduce and replicate [many research papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility) 
during [artifact evaluation](https://cTuning.org/ae), we have seen that reviewers spend most of their time
deciphering numerous ad-hoc READMEs to figure out how to prepare and run shared applications. 

That motivated us to develop a [human readable language (Collective Mind)](../README.md#collective-mind-language-cm) 
to automate and unify the [most commonly used tasks](../list_of_scripts.md) 
to reproduce or replicate shared applications across the same or different software, hardware, models and data.

The goal of our common automation and reproducibility interface is to make it easier for the community 
to reproduce/replicate research results and apply them in the real world.

## Installing CM language

CM requires minimal dependencies (Python 3+ and Git) and it should be straightforward to install it
on Linux, MacOS, Windows and any other platform using this [guide](../installation.md).
