# Collective Mind framework aka as CK2 or CM

*Following the success of the [Collective Knowledge framework (CK)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck)
to automate [MLPerf benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation), 
simplify the deployment of optimized AI/ML systems [in production](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html)
and enable [reproducible experiments](https://cTuning.org/ae), 
we are preparing a major redesign and simplification of this collaborative tool based on the community feedback.*

Our long term goal is to make it easier to transfer research ideas to production systems,
reduce the time to market for innovative AI and ML products,
accelerate open science and solve the real-world challenges.

Our [past experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4) 
suggests that the major obstacle to achieve these goals 
is the growing gap between tools, platforms, environments 
and methodologies used for research and in production: 
see related [journal article]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf ),
[position paper]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07161.pdf )
and the [General Motors presentation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI ).

That is why we are developing CM as a simple and collaborative playground 
to help the community learn how to bridge this gap by interconnecting MLOps, DevOps, data science, 
scientific experimentation, FAIR principles, and best practices for reproducible research.

# Development

* [The alpha version of the CM prototype](https://github.com/octoml/cm/tree/mvp)

# Projects

* Unifying MLPerf benchmarking across different ML models, datasets, ML frameworks and platforms
* Making it easier to deploy ML models in production across continuously changing software and hardware stacks

# Feedback

The CM framework is being developed with the community and based on the community feedback! 
Please don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any suggestions about how to
bridge the growing gap between scientific research and production.
