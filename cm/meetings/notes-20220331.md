# 20220331: CM meeting in London

* Brainstorming CM (aka CK2) functionality from CK user experience:
    - passing env/files to *package* installation stages
    - better versioning (master/dev branch)
    - support inheritance
    - experiment reproducibility features
    - specifying parameters of a target platform and inheriting parameters from similar ones?
    - Docker: sometimes failed because some website for some package is not available (CK package can actually help by providing several URLs with stable packages)
    - How to work under firewall (install packages) ...
    - How to better support edge devices ...
    - cmdgen is useful but too declarative and difficult to understand and extend - need to mix code + data
    - improve error messages and handling (G: I think it should be done with a platform)
      - do not write manually ck steps like "ck install package" - error-prone - however, maybe in CM all such steps 
        (including apt-get for example) can become a depenedency itself, so CM can generate the list of all commands 
        for reproducibility ... 
      - Grigori: CK "package" term is very ambiguous  change to "artifact" or "obj"?
      - Can't install multiple packages with similar tags - will be overwritten in env - there is a mechanism but not very user friendly
    - CM core
        - "cm artifact install imaget-net" vs "ck install artifact:imagenet-net"
        - "cm env":
        - "cm docker build"
        - "cm venv"
        - "cm experiment"
        - G: can we use "." in the module name (do not install individual automations via pip but the whole repo)
        - unify terminology for all CM components
        - Provide docs and APIs
    - CM meta-package (artifact or object)
        - NAME: artifact? Check that no ambiguity ...
        - It can be used for any artifact and step (platform detect, apt-get, config setting, pip install, model download, dataset detect).
        - TO THINK:
            - API + META: list, install, detect;
                - Probably need "env":
                * API + META: list (also filter by sub-dependencies since no host/target/os - become deps themselves), load ?*
            - **How to use tags to differentiate different artifacts, version (variations)**
                -tags, -no-tags, DOCUMENT FUNCTIONALITY ...
            - How to pass to and return env variables (embed into JSON dict)
            - How to pass to and return some files (embed into JSON dict)
            - Add platform, OS as dependency too
           
    - CM portable pipeline - artfiact: 
      (maybe "cm artifact run" instead of extra abstraction - what to do it artifact can't run)

        - **DISCUSS:** CMD AND DEPS FOR COMPILE AND RUN AND OTHER CMD ...
           - install/compile/run becomes sub-action to an artifact with their own deps and cmd ...
        - list of dependencies (dict) - will be needed in artifact too
        - get rid of dictionaries
        - tags, no tags, versions, specialization on previous dependency and env - how to specify -
           - THINK ABOUT PROGRAMMATIC WAY TO SPECIALIZE DEPS
           - CHECK default behavior for "artifact install" - should it try to detect first or just force install ...
        - NEED TO THINK HOW TO SPECIALIZE FURTHER DEPENDENCIES IN THE LIST BASED ON PRE

    - CK extras:
        - "experiment" for validating past results (testing that they were performed correctly)
