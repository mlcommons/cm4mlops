# 20220622: CM conf-call

* Testing --version, --version-min, --version-max

* Discussing get-{tool} (similar to ck detect soft) vs install-{tool} (similar to ck install package)

* version-max is inclusive - should it be exclusive?
  Funny case to compare versions with version-max inclusive:
   $ cm compare_versions utils --version1=3.10.0 --version2=3.10.-1 --out=json

* discussed how to assemble run-{OS}-{VER}-{Platform} script with less ambiguity.
  (useful to install transformers on ARM64) - need to prototype ...

TBD:

* Discovered issues with installation when default_version is higher than version-max
  Grigori will test it (install-python-src)
* install-python-src does not add binary to a path - needs to be fixed
