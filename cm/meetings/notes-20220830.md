# 20220830: CM conf-call

* Thomas provided the [status of his internship](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/issues/265).

  He made a good progress and plans to deliver the first prototype of a modular MLPerf image classification task combined with loadgen (without CM automation for now) within a week.
  
  No problems encountered but it take longer time because Thomas checks C++ implementations from different organizations to make sure that his implementation is efficient and extensible.

* We prepared a list of all necessary improvements in CM and MLPerf docs 
  * CM-based MLPerf submission demo
  * CM MLPerf WG
  * TVM back-end in MLPerf
  * educational initiatives for the next submission round
