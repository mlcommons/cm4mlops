# 20220907: CM conf-call

* Tested prototype of the new C++ front-end for MLPerf loadgen
  to completely separate it from models, datasets and hardware.
  It works fine for ONNX, image classificaiton and ImageNet.
  We plan to add CM workflows next time!

* Discussed required updates to all READMEs and docs.

* Discussed a few bugs (open tickets) and how to fix them - nothing critical.

* Discussed extra tests for CM (packages installation, Docker tests)
 
* Discussed how to continue operating our workgroup with more colleagues willing to join.
