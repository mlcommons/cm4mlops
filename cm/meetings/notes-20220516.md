# 20220511: CM conf-call

* Discussing next IC improvements for deterministic DevOps and MLOps:

  * Changing CM_PATH_LIST to +PATH
  * Adding general support for +ENV that is expanded to ENV=val1;val2;...:${ENV}

  * Extending ic::prototype-detect-os:
    * return ENV about OS flavor (macos, ubuntu, debian, centos)
    * return ENV about OS ver (22.04)

  * Extending ic::prototype-get-cpu-info:
    * return host CPU type (x8664...)
    * return host CPU flavor (m1)

  * Adding support to specialize run.sh or run.bat based on above notes. Idea is to check scripts in the following order:
    * run-${CM_OS_HOST_FLAVOR}-${CM_OS_HOST_VER}-${CM_CPU_FLAVOR}.sh
    * run-${CM_OS_HOST_FLAVOR}-${CM_OS_HOST_VER}.sh
    * run-${CM_OS_HOST_FLAVOR}.sh
    * run.sh

    Each script can call other scripst from the same IC automation

    In the future, we can add support in customization.py to run numerous scripts inside 1 IC based on host OS, target OS, target CPU/GPU/TPU/DSP (run-UID.sh).

  * Adding support to specialize run.sh for the target platform (GPU/DSP/TPU) - to be discussed further ...
