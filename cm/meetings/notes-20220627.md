# 20220627: CM conf-call

TBD for this week:

* Add readme.md in a script to describe limitations (such as in TF)
* Check that we delete local env inside dependencies loop
* Add enable_if_env flag and --skip-if-env
* Detect TF, ONNX-RT, PyTorch, TVM via Python first; check version ranges; and install only if missing ...
* Add get/install transformers
* Add "cm show cache" (print tags, new ENV, versions from ENV)                                 
* Add "cm test script" (agree on how to implement tests (directory inside each script artifact))
* Add "cm get-cid ." to get the {automation UID}::{artifact UID} for a given CM artifact
* Test "get-gcc" with corner detection script
* Move stable scripts to mlcommons@ck-devops when ready ...
