# 20220406: CM conf-call

## User feedback

* Improve Getting started guide:
    - Should demonstrate CM repository not from Git but on any local directory
    - Should show that do not have to use $HOME/CM but any local directory
      (G: alredy supported)
    - tags

* Improve the CM core:
   - simplify automations (no individual PIP install?)
   - remove slow automation search via PIP (do it later)

* Better explain the CM concept
    - universal power adaptor in different countries
    - using English language instead of numerous dialects

* Simplify implementatin of variations of artifacts 
  to update versions and environment variables

   - use specific tag prefix such as "var-" or "v-".
     in such case we can remove them from the list of tags and perform simple search!
   - use variation key in _cm.json to math this tag
   - use the order of original variation tags to 
     - update original env variables (for detect, install, run)
     - update other keys (check if need to append values)
     - allow inheritance on another CM artifact
   - check if directory with the same variation exists and use scripts from there

* Improve aggregation of all dependencies before running some script or program

  - can we get rid of CK env.sh file and process all env variables inside CM?
  - maybe can check a delta before and after detecting/installing a given artifact?
    - how to handle vars that aggregate values (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, INCLUDE, etc)?
