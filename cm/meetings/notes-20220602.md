# 20220602: CM conf-call

* Discussing the latest IC improvements:

  * improved logic to make detection and installation of LLVM more deterministic

    * added --path flag that is converted to CM_PATH environment variable
      it can be used in pre/postprocessing to specify where to search for components (like LLVM or datasets)

    * added --version flag that is converted to CM_NEED_VERSION environment variable
      to specify the version of a component to be installed (such as LLVM 14.0.0)

    * added --skip-install flag to skip caching in "installed" entries.
      useful to chain 2 scripts such as installing prebuilt LLVM and then detecting it using CM_PATH ...

    * added --new to skip searching in "installed" entries, rerun the script and create a new entry.
      Useful to detect another version of installed LLVM for example.

    * added support "post_deps" in _cm.json to run ICs after a given IC

  * used the above functionality to implement 2 new IC:
    * prototype-get-llvm-any - to detect installed LLVM
    * prototype-get-llvm-prebuilt - to download and install prebuilt LLVM from GitHub (Linux, Windows, MacOS)
                                    and finalize installation using "prototype-get-llvm-any" script


* Next steps:

  * change "ic" to a more intuitive "script"!
  * add "deps" into variations in IC meta to be merged with "deps" 

  * add IC to install "requirements.txt" via Python PIP

  * add "aliases" in "deps" to be able to update tags via CLI or from variations
  * add detection/installation IC for TVM with different variations

  * add example to compile and run simple C program with LLVM

  * add detection/installation IC for ONNX + run-time
  * add detection/installation IC for PyTorch
