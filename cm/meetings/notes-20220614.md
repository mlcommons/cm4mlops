# 20220602: CM conf-call

* News:
  * discussed "cm copy"
  * discussed "tvm install" status
  * decided to rewrite "script" to keep only global "env" and "state"
    and automatically detect difference in env and state 
    after a given script - this is a major change that will require major update
