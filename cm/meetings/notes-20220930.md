# 20220930: CM hackathon in London

## Must be fixed:

* If we use --quiet in scripts with "get compiler", get-cl is used first instead of get-gcc or get-llvm.

  We can add "sort" + "default" key to meta of these sub-scripts to define the order + default scripts ...

  Need to think that default scripts can be dependent on the OS (can enforce using ENV).

* Mix up when pulling first mlcommons@ck repo and then octoml@ck repo.

  We need to check that alias is the same and then do not allow pulling 
  
  PRINT CM REPO ALIAS AFTER PULLING: "you can reference this CM repo using alias "mlcommons@cm-mlops" ...

* Make sure that we do not contaminate env/state by default (remove "else" statement)
  * Check scripst that depend on get-os that these vars are not exported ...

* Improve get/install scripts:
  * Add "install" as a prehook_deps in block "get" by some ENV if we want to force install

* Add test automation for indivudal components
  cm test script ...
  Will have meta (YAML/JSON) describing the matrix of runs and how to test output 
  Need to be discussed more!

* We only detect one version of python3. Let's stay python38. However if we ask for version 3.9 and python39 is installed, we will not search for it ...
  We need to search for all pythonX...

* Make adding new scripts more user friendly:
  * cm add script (run.sh/bat + README + TESTS)
  * Automatically create README.md (convert old _info _tbd to ...)
  * Automatically create customize.py with all functions and run.sh/run.bat ...

* Check/improve python-venv when we finalize all updates to scripts


## To check

* Check image corner detection app when we use get-gcc and then get-llvm at the same time
