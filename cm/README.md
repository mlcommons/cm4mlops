### About

The Collective Knowledge project (CK) is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing experiments 
from [150 research papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility)
and validating them in the real world - we decided to develop a universal and human-readable 
interface to access any software project and run it on any platform with any software, hardware and data.

The [Collective Mind tool (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm/cmind)
helps users to add this universal interface to their software projects and transform them into a 
[database of portable and reusable components](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md)
in a transparent and non-intrusive way.

CM is being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://cKnowledge.org/mlcommons-taskforce) 
to solve the "dependency hell" for ML and AI systems, reduce their development, benchmarking, optimization and deployment time and costs,
and automate [reproducibility initiatives and artifact evaluation at conferences](https://cTuning.org/ae).
