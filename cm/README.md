# About

Collective Mind (CM) is a cross-platform tool that helps to make software projects more portable, modular, reusable, reproducible and adaptable 
to continuously changing software, hardware and data. 
It is being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
to help the community reduce development, benchmarking, optimization and deployment time for ML and AI systems.
