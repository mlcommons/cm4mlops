# Collective Mind framework

**Collective Knowledge concept (CK)** provides a simple and non-intrusive way to share your software projects, 
experiments, knowledge and READMEs as a database of [reusable, portable and interconnected scripts and files](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md)
with a [human-readable CLI](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/tutorials/sc22-scc-mlperf.md), Python API and JSON/YAML meta descriptions.

Motivated by our [tedious experience reproducing 150+ ML and Systems papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility), 
the goal is to provide a common and automated way to reproduce and reuse any experiment
on any platform with any software, hardware and data.

**Collective Mind framework (CM aka CK2)** is the second implementation 
of the CK concept being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
as a [small Python library](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm/cmind) 
with a unified CLI and minimal dependencies.

CM helps you to assemble ML and AI Systems from [portable, reusable and interoperable CM scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md)
and automate their benchmarking, optimization and deployment across rapidly evolving software, hardware and data
from the cloud to the edge.
