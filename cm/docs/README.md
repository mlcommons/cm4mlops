# Collective Mind documentation

The MLCommons Collective Mind automation meta-framework (CM) is the second implementation
of the [Collective Knowledge concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149).
It helps to unify, manage, connect and reuse any artifacts, scripts, tools and workflows 
on any platform with any software and hardware stack. 

CM is being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to modularize ML and AI systems and automate their co-design, benchmarking, 
optimization and deployment across continuously changing software, hardware and data.
