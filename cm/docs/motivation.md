# Motivation

CM is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ Systems and Machine Learning papers](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility)
when [our colleagues](https://ctuning.org/ae/committee.html) have spent many frustrating months communicating with each other 
and trying to understand numerous technical reports, README files, specifications, dependencies, 
ad-hoc scripts, tools, APIs, models and data sets of all shared projects 
to be able to [validate experimental results](https://cknowledge.io/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22) 
and adapt ad-hoc projects to the real world with very diverse 
software, hardware, user environments, settings and data.

## Community effort

The open-source Collective Mind toolkit (CM aka CK2) is our community effort to solve above problems 
by making existing DevOps and MLOps more portable, interoperable, deterministic, reusable and reproducible 
with minimal or no changes to existing projects!

CM transforms existing projects into an [open database of intelligent components (IC)](https://github.com/octoml/cm-mlops/tree/main/ic) 
that simply wrap existing user scripts and artifacts 
to provide a common API and extensible meta descriptions 
with dependencies on other IC and platforms.

Such evolutionary approach helps to avoid vendor lock-in on specific workflow frameworks and platforms
while simplifying and automating the development and deployment of complex applications
across rapidly evolving software and hardware stacks from the cloud to the edge.

## 2nd generation of the CK technology

The open-source CM toolkit is the 2nd generation of the [Collective Knowledge framework (CK)]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was [successfully validated in academia and industry]( https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html ) in the past years 
to enable collaborative and reproducible development, opitmization and deployment
of Pareto-efficient ML Systems in terms of accuracy, latency, throughput, energy, size and costs
across continuously changing software and hardware.

CM also helps to transform Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks, zip/tar files
and any local directory into a collective database of reusable artifacts 
and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

Our long-term goal is to help researchers and engineers exchange their artifacts, knowledge, 
experience and best practices in a more automated, reusable, portable and unified way
across rapidly evolving software and hardware.
