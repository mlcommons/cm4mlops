# Reusable CM-based MLOps components

We work with the community to reproduce existing [AI, ML and Systems projects](https://cTuning.org/ae) 
and transform them into [reusable CM components](https://github.com/octoml/cm-mlops).

We want to fully automate the development and optimization of Pareto-efficient computational 
systems across continuously changing software and hardware stacks to accelerate their deployment
in the real world.

# Development

* GitHub repository with CM components: https://github.com/octoml/cm-mlops

## Universal CM object for MLOps and DevOps

We are developing a universal CM "object" to support automatic detection, download, 
installation and execution of all artifacts required to prepare, deploy and run intelligent systems
(code, model, data set, pre/post processing and deployment scripts).

*Stay tuned for more details ...*
