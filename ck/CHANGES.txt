    https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md

* V2.6.1:
  * fixed convert_json_str_to_dict func to support Python 3.9+
    (see the issue #184)

* MLCommons CK V2.6.0

20210906:
  * cTuning foundation and OctoML donated this repository to MLCommons
    as a part of their MLPerf inference benchmark v1.1 submission.

* v2.5.8.1
  * minor enhancement of "ck display dashboard" automation module
    to support the latest format of the MLPerf benchmark
  * cmdgen changes to support groups (issue #180)
  * CK kernel setting "package_quiet_install"

  * important fix in "module:program" detected while preparing 
    MLPerf inference out-of-the-box benchmarking:
    clean tmp directory when running CK workflow
    that doesn't have compilation!
  * added --remove_deps flag to module:program and module:env
    as suggested by CK users to be able to remove some dependencies 
    from CK program workflows and thus use natively installed compilers, 
    tools, libraries and other components - useful to debugging and testing.
    This flag takes a list of keys from dependencies from a given
    program workflows separated by comma.
  * added the latest contributors to the CK project.

    when installing CK repositories.
    Turn it on as follows:
    $ ck set kernel var.pip_user=yes
    See ticket #157
  * print path to the CK kernel when invoking "ck"
  * extended "result" module to use meta.json as a base for all sub configurations
    (to simplify configuration for multiple dashboards - useful for MLPerf)

  * improved module:result to push results to CK dashboards
  * improved module:dashboard to work with new CK dashboards
  * improved module:wfe to work with new CK dashboards

    (moved cbench functionality from the CK incubator to the CK module
     to work with cKnowledge.io dashboards directly)
  * provided better support to work with CK modules
    as standard Python packages (see module:ck-platform as example)

    for a given command line (for example, only to install python deps
    for a given program)

  * auto-install Python requirements from pulled repositories
  * added --bash to docker:module to run bash in a container

  * fixed function "ck status"

* V2.2.0

    we keep original meta of a given entry when updating, copying or moving it
    rather than expanding it with all the base entries.

* V2.1.0
  * added support for basic inheritance in CK entries via "_base_entry" key.
    Useful to simplify program, package and soft modules.
    See https://github.com/ctuning/ck/issues/143 .

  * We now use Python to generate ck and ck.bat scripts!
    If you install CK for different python versions, 
    you can use a specific one as follows:
    python3.7 -m ck version

* V2.0.0
  * We now use Apache 2.0 license based on the feedback from the majority of users

  * adding ck.safe_float and ck.safe_int (for safe sorting - used when sorting crowdtuning results)
  * fixing detection of a right Python version
  * adding 'renew repo' function to completely remove polluted and shared repository,
    and pull new one (Issue #12) 
  * adding support to forbid deleting in specific repos
    (useful only to aggregate information such as during crowdtuning)

* V1.6.12
  * adding CK_PYTHON env variable in ck script 
    to let user select required python version (python or python3)
  * automatically detecting python3 or python on Linux
  * fixing license of a php OpenME code - now the same as CK
    (tiny part to connect PHP-based web requests to CK)
  * adding 'find' function to 'repo' module and changing
    default behavior. Now "ck find repo:<name>" returns
    path to repository rather than to meta. To return
    path to meta, use "ck find repo:<name> --meta".
    Closes ticket #45
  * automatically detecting server host and port, if used!
    Closes ticket #38

     (suggested by Anton)

  * adding --min flag to ''load'' function to output 
    only desc and dict to console
