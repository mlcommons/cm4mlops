CK framework documentation
==========================

.. epigraph::

Collective Knowledge framework (CK) helps to organize any software project
as a database of reusable components (algorithms, datasets, models, frameworks, scripts, 
experimental results, papers, etc) with common automation actions
and extensible meta descriptions based on FAIR principles
(findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability).

The ultimate goal is to help everyone share, reuse, and extend their knowledge
in the form of reusable artifacts and portable workflows with a common API, CLI,
and JSON meta description. 

See how CK helps to support collaborative and reproducible AI, ML, and systems R&D
in some real-world use cases from Arm, General Motors, IBM, MLPerf(tm), the Raspberry Pi foundation, 
and ACM: https://cKnowledge.org/partners.
