# CK workflows for object detection with TFLite

* [Old CK workflow](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops/tree/main/program/object-detection-tflite-loadgen)

# Reproducibility studies

* [RPi4](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-automation/reproduce/ck-object-detection-rpi4-tflite.md)

# Future work

We plan to update above workflow to be compatible with our 
[new end-to-end MLPerf submission workflow](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops/tree/main/module/bench.mlperf.inference).
