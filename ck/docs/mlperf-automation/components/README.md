# CK components for ML Systems (automation recipes)

Over the past few years we've collected many CK components
and automation recipes for ML Systems in [this public repo](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck-mlops)
(ML models, frameworks, tools, data sets, portable workflows, autotuning scripts, etc).

We now work with the community and MLCommons to test and unify these components.
Feel free to help and/or provide your feedback [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/issues)!
