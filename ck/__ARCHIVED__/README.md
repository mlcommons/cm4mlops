Grigori Fursin and the [cTuning foundation](https://cTuning.org) 
donated their [Collective Knowledge workflow automation framework aka CK (v1 and v2)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0211)
to [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org) in 2021. 

In 2022, we started developing the next generation of the CK workflow ([Collective Mind aka CM](../../cm))
as a community project led by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](../../docs/taskforce.md) 
based on the feedback from our users and MLCommons members.

After successfully validating CM to automate MLPerf inference submissions, we have deprecated the CK framework.

This directory is in the archive mode and not updated anymore.

and the [journal article](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0211).

You can check ideas behind the new CM framework in this [ACM REP'23 keynote](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339).
